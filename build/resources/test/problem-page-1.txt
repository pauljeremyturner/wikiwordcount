The '''Environmental Protection Agency''' ('''EPA''') is an [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agency]] of the [[United States federal government]] for [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do |title=Our Mission and What We Do|date=January 21, 2017 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Richard Nixon]] proposed the establishment of EPA on July 9, 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/reorganization-plan-no-3-1970.html|title=Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970|last=EPA,OA,OEAEE,OWC|first=US|website=archive.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it began operation on December 2, 1970, after Nixon signed an [[executive order]]. The [[Reorganization Plan No. 3|order establishing the EPA]] was ratified by committee hearings in the House and Senate. The agency is led by its [[Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency|Administrator]], who is appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and approved by Congress. The current acting Administrator following the resignation of [[Scott Pruitt]] is  Deputy Administrator [[Andrew R. Wheeler|Andrew Wheeler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/politics/andrew-wheeler-epa/index.html|title=A former coal lobbyist is the new leader of the EPA|last=CNN|first=Sophie Tatum,|work=CNN|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA is not a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] department, but the Administrator is normally given [[Cabinet of the United States#Cabinet-level officials|cabinet rank]].

The EPA has its headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], regional offices for each of the agency's ten [[#EPA regions|regions]], and 27 laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/regionallabs/epa-regional-laboratories-unique-analytical-capabilities-and-services-region |title=EPA Regional Laboratories Unique Analytical Capabilities and Services by Region |date=September 12, 2017 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency conducts [[environmental assessment]], research, and education. It has the responsibility of maintaining and enforcing national standards under a variety of environmental laws, in consultation with state, tribal, and local governments. It delegates some permitting, monitoring, and enforcement responsibility to [[U.S. state]]s and the [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized tribes]]. EPA enforcement powers include fines, [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and other measures. The agency also works with industries and all levels of government in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.

In 2018, the agency had 14,172 full-time employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA's Budget and Spending&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/planandbudget/budget|title=EPA's Budget and Spending|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.|date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than half of EPA's employees are engineers, scientists, and environmental protection specialists; other employees include legal, public affairs, financial, and information technologists. In 2017 the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] proposed a 31% cut to the EPA's budget to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Hiroko Tabuchi |title=What's at Stake in Trump's Proposed E.P.A. Cuts |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/climate/trump-epa-budget-cuts.html |date=April 10, 2017 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this cut was not approved by Congress.

The Environmental Protection Agency can only act under statutes, which are the authority of laws passed by Congress. Congress must approve the statute and they also have the power to authorize or prohibit certain actions, which the EPA has to implement and enforce. Appropriations statutes authorize how much money the agency can spend each year to carry out the approved statutes. The Environmental Protection Agency has the power to issue regulations. A regulation is a standard or rule written by the agency to interpret the statute, apply it in situations and enforce it. Congress allows the EPA to write regulations in order to solve a problem, but the agency must include a rationale of why the regulations need to be implemented. The regulations can be challenged by the Courts, where the regulation is overruled or confirmed. Many public health and environmental groups advocate for the agency and believe that it is creating a better world. Other critics believe that the agency commits government overreach by adding unnecessary regulations on business and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vig|first1=Norman J.|title=Environmental Policy: New Directions for the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Sage|isbn=978-1-5063-8346-0|year=2018|pages=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1950s and through the 1960s, Congress reacted to increasing public concern about the impact that human activity could have on the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distillations&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-clean-air-act-1970/1977 |title=EPA History: Clean Air Act of 1970/1977 |date=October 18, 2016 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.epa.gov/epa/aboutepa/guardian-origins-epa.html |title=The Guardian: Origins of the EPA |date=Spring 1992 |series=EPA Historical Publication |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[James E. Murray]] introduced a bill, the Resources and Conservation Act (RCA) of 1959, in the [[86th United States Congress|86th Congress]]. The 1962 publication of ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] alerted the public about the detrimental effects on the environment of the indiscriminate use of [[pesticide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Griswold |first=Eliza |date=September 21, 2012 |title=How 'Silent Spring' Ignited the Environmental Movement |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/magazine/how-silent-spring-ignited-the-environmental-movement.html |work=New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following, similar bills were introduced and hearings were held to discuss the state of the environment and Congress's potential responses. In 1968, a joint House–Senate colloquium was convened by the chairmen of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]], and the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, Representative [[George P. Miller]], to discuss the need for and means of implementing a national environmental policy. In the colloquium, some members of Congress expressed a continuing concern over federal agency actions affecting the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Luther |first=Linda |url=http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/Unit1_01CRSReport.pdf |title=The National Environmental Policy Act: Background and Implementation |date=2005 |publisher=U.S. Congressional Research Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527185951/http://www.fta.dot.gov/documents/Unit1_01CRSReport.pdf |archivedate=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Ruckelshaus Swearing In as EPA Administrator.jpg|thumb|left|Ruckelshaus sworn in as first EPA Administrator.]]
On July 9, 1970, Nixon proposed an [[Reorganization Plan No. 3|executive reorganization]] that consolidated many environmental responsibilities of the federal government under one agency, a new Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 9, 1970 |title=Reorganization Plans Nos. 3 and 4 of 1970. Message from the President of the United States to the House of Representatives |series=House of Representatives, 91st Congress, 2d Session |url=https://archive.epa.gov/ocir/leglibrary/pdf/created.pdf |id=Document no. 91-366}}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal included merging antipollution programs from a number of departments, such as the combination of pesticide programs from the United States Department of Agriculture, Department of Interior, and U.S. Department of Interior.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/600A1DB1B9EF1E85.pdf#page=5|title=Transcript of “Behind the Scenes at the Creation of the EPA” Video|last=Elkins|first=Chuck|date=October 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting hearings during that summer, the House and Senate approved the proposal. The EPA was created 90 days before it had to operate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/600A1DB1B9EF1E85.pdf#page=11|title=Transcript of “Behind the Scenes at the Creation of the EPA” Video|last=Elkins|first=Chuck|date=October 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and officially opened its doors on December 2, 1970. The agency's first Administrator, [[William Ruckelshaus]], took the oath of office on December 4, 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA-guardian&quot;/&gt;  In its first year, the EPA had a budget of $1.4 billion and 5,800 employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt; At its start, the EPA was primarily a technical assistance agency that set goals and standards. Soon, new acts and amendments passed by Congress gave the agency its regulatory authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/600A1DB1B9EF1E85.pdf#page=9|title=Transcript of “Behind the Scenes at the Creation of the EPA” Video|last=Elkins|first=Chuck|date=October 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA staff recall that in the early days there was &quot;an enormous sense of purpose and excitement&quot; and the expectation that &quot;there was this agency which was going to do something about a problem that clearly was on the minds of a lot of people in this country,&quot; leading to tens of thousands of resumes from those eager to participate in the mighty effort to clean up America's environment.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=2 Transcript] (see p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;

When EPA first began operation, members of the private sector felt strongly that the environmental protection movement was a passing fad. Ruckelshaus stated that he felt pressure to show a public which was deeply skeptical about government's effectiveness, that EPA could respond effectively to widespread concerns about pollution.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=4 Transcript] (see p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the EPA was created, Congress enacted the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, better known as the [[Clean Water Act]]. This act established a national framework for addressing water quality to be implemented by agency in partnership with the states&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot;&gt;Jim Hanlon, Mike Cook, Mike Quigley, Bob Wayland. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/waterquality.pdf “Water Quality: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1972, Congress also amended the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act|Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act,]] requiring the newly formed EPA to measure every pesticide's risks against its potential benefits&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;Susan Wayland and Penelope Fenner-Crisp. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/pesticides.pdf “Reducing Pesticide Risks: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;. Four years later, in October 1976,Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act, which like [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act|FIFRA]] related to commercial products rather than pollution&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;Auer, Charles, Frank Kover, James Aidala, Marks Greenwood. [http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/toxics.pdf “Toxic Substances: A Half Century of Progress.”] EPA Alumni Association. March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;. This act gave the EPA the authority to gather information on chemicals and require producers to test them, gave it the ability to regulate chemical production and use (with specific mention of PCBs), and required the agency to create the National Inventory listing of chemicals&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;.

The same year, the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] was passed, significantly amending the [[Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965]]. It tasked the EPA with setting national goals for waste disposal, conserving energy and natural resources, reducing waste, and ensuring environmentally sound management of waste. Accordingly, the agency developed regulations for solid and hazardous waste that were to be implemented in collaboration with states.&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot;&gt;Horinko, Marianne, Cathryn Courtin. “[http://www.epaalumni.org/hcp/rcra.pdf Waste Management: A Half Century of Progress].” EPA Alumni Association. March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, nicknamed “Superfund,” which enabled the EPA to cast a wider net for parties responsible for sites contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal (such as Love Canal) and established a funding mechanism for assessment and cleanup.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In April 1986, when the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] disaster occurred, the EPA was tasked with identifying any impacts on the United States and keeping the public informed. Administrator Lee Thomas assembled a cross-agency team, including personnel from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of Energy to monitor the situation. They held press conferences for 10 days&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator. [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60740780F5ACB3D5.pdf#page=9 Video], Transcript (see p9). April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. This same year, Congress passed the [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]], which authorized the EPA to gather data on toxic chemicals and share this information with the public&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;.

The EPA also researched the implications of stratospheric ozone depletion. Under the leadership of Administrator Lee Thomas, the EPA joined with several international organizations to perform a risk assessment of stratospheric ozone&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=28 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60740780F5ACB3D5.pdf#page=1 Transcript] (see p14). April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;, which helped provide motivation for the Montreal Protocol, which was agreed to in August 1987.

In 1988, during his first presidential campaign, [[George H. W. Bush]] was vocal about environmental issues. He appointed as his EPA administrator [[William K. Reilly]], an environmentalist. Under Reilly’s leadership, the EPA implemented voluntary programs and a cluster rule for multimedia regulation. At the time, the environment was increasingly being recognized as a regional issue, which was reflected in 1990 amendment of the Clean Air Act and new approaches by the agency&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA.

===Regions===
[[File:Regions of the United States EPA.svg|thumb|The administrative regions of the United States Environmental Protection Agency.]]
Creating 10 EPA regions was an initiative that came from President Richard Nixon.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Former EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus and his senior assistants discuss integrating 10 regional offices into the fledgling agency.

{{Missing information|section|several major EPA programs|date=October 2010}}

It is worth noting that, in looking back in 2013 on the agency he helped shape from the beginning, Administrator William Ruckelshaus observed that a danger for EPA was that air, water, waste and other programs would be unconnected, placed in &quot;silos,&quot; a problem that persists more than 50 years later, albeit less so than at the start.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: EPA Administrator William Ruckelshaus comments on the &quot;silos&quot; problem that has dogged EPA from the start in an interview in which he and some of his closest aides recall the opening months of the new agency in 1970, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=16 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/605EA9C8EF2DD115.pdf#page=11 Transcript] (see p. 11).&lt;/ref&gt;

===EPA Safer Choice===
The [[EPA Safer Choice]] label, previously known as the Design for the Environment (DfE) label, helps consumers and commercial buyers identify and select products with safer chemical ingredients, without sacrificing quality or performance. When a product has the Safer Choice label, it means that every intentionally-added ingredient in the product has been evaluated by EPA scientists. Only the safest possible functional ingredients are allowed in products with the Safer Choice label.

===Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative===
Through the [[EPA Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative|Safer Detergents Stewardship Initiative]] (SDSI),&lt;ref name=&quot;sdsi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/dfe/pubs/projects/formulat/sdsi.htm |title=EPA SDSI Home Page |publisher=Epa.gov |date=December 22, 2008 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA's Design for the Environment (DfE) recognizes environmental leaders who voluntarily commit to the use of safer [[surfactants]]. Safer surfactants are the ones that break down quickly to non-polluting compounds and help protect aquatic life in both fresh and salt water. [[Nonylphenol ethoxylates]], commonly referred to as NPEs, are an example of a surfactant class that does not meet the definition of a safer surfactant.

The Design for the Environment, which was renamed to [[EPA Safer Choice]] in 2015, has identified safer alternative surfactants through partnerships with industry and environmental advocates. These safer alternatives are comparable in cost and are readily available. CleanGredients&lt;ref name=&quot;cleangredients&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleangredients.org |title=CleanGredients Home Page |publisher=Cleangredients.org |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a source of safer surfactants.

=== Energy Star ===
In 1992 the EPA launched the [[Energy Star]] program, a voluntary program that fosters energy efficiency. This program came out an increased effort to collaborate with industry. At the start, it motivated major companies to retrofit millions of square feet of building space with more efficient lighting&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=10 Transcript] (see p 7, 10). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2006, more than 40,000 Energy Star products were available including major appliances, office equipment, lighting, home electronics, and more. In addition, the label can also be found on new homes and commercial and industrial buildings. In 2006, about 12 percent of new housing in the [[United States]] was labeled Energy Star.&lt;ref name=EPA2006&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.energystar.gov/ia/news/downloads/annual_report_2006.pdf &quot;2006 Annual Report: Energy Star and Other Climate Protection Partnerships.&quot;]. Retrieved March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA estimates it saved about $14 billion in energy costs in 2006 alone. The Energy Star program has helped spread the use of [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[traffic light]]s, efficient [[fluorescent light]]ing, [[power management]] systems for office equipment, and low [[standby power|standby]] energy use.&lt;ref&gt;EnergyStar.gov, [http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=about.ab_history &quot;History: Energy Star.&quot;]. Retrieved March 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smart Growth===
EPA's Smart Growth Program, which began in 1998, is to help communities improve their development practices and get the type of development they want. Together with local, state, and national experts, EPA encourages development strategies that protect human health and the environment, create economic opportunities, and provide attractive and affordable neighborhoods for people of all income levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth |title=Smart Growth US EPA |website=Epa.gov |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticides===
EPA regulates pesticides under the [[Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act]] (FIFRA) (which is much older than the agency) and the [[Food Quality Protection Act]]&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;. It assesses, registers, regulates, and regularly reevaluates all [[pesticide]]s legally sold in the United States. A few challenges this program faces are transforming toxicity testing, screening pesticides for endocrine disruptors, and regulating biotechnology and nanotechnology&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;.

=== The Land Disposal Restrictions Program ===
This program sets treatment requirements for hazardous waste before it may be disposed of on land. I began issuing treatment methods and levels of requirements in 1986 and these are continually adapted to new hazardous wastes and treatment technologies. The stringent requirements it sets and its emphasis on waste minimization practices encourage businesses to plan to minimize waste generation and prioritize reuse and recycling. From the start of the program in 1984 to 2004, the volume of hazardous waste disposed in landfills had decreased 94% and the volume of hazardous waste disposed of by underground injection had decreased 70%&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;.

=== Superfund ===
In the late 1970s, the need to clean up sites such as [[Love Canal]] that had been highly contaminated by previous hazardous waste disposal became apparent. However the existing regulatory environment depended on owners or operators to perform environmental control. While the EPA attempted to use RCRA’s section 7003 to perform this cleanup, it was clear a new law was needed. In 1980, Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, nicknamed “[[Superfund]].” This law enabled the EPA to cast a wider net for responsible parties, including past or present generators and transporters as well as current and past owners of the site to find funding. The act also established some funding and a tax mechanism on certain industries to help fund such cleanup. The latter was not renewed in the 1990s, which means funding now comes from general approprations. Today, due to restricted funding, most cleanup is performed by responsible parties under the oversight of the EPA and states. As of 2016, more than 1,700 sites had been put on the cleanup list since the creation of the program. Of these, 370 sites have been cleaned up and removed from the list, cleanup is underway at 535, cleanup facilities have been constructed at 790 but need to be operated in the future, and 54 are not yet in cleanup stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

=== Brownfields Program ===
This program, which was started as a pilot program in the 1990s and signed into law in 2002, provides grants and tools to local governments for the assessment, cleanup, and revitalization of [[Brownfield land|brownfields]]. As of September 2015, the EPA estimates that program grants have resulted in 56,442 acres of land readied for reuse and leveraged 116,963 jobs and $24.2 billion to do so. Agency studies also found that property values around assessed or cleaned-up brownfields have increased 5.1 to 12.8 percent&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Thomas Voltaggio and John Adams.

===Fuel Economy===
The testing system was originally developed in 1972 and used [[driving cycle]]s designed to simulate driving during rush-hour in [[Los Angeles]] during that era. Until 1984 the EPA reported the exact fuel economy figures calculated from the test. {{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In 1984, the EPA began adjusting city (aka [[UDDS|Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule]] or [[UDDS]]) results downward by 10% and highway (aka HighWay Fuel Economy Test or HWFET) results by 22% to compensate for changes in driving conditions since 1972, and to better correlate the EPA test results with real-world driving. In 1996, the EPA proposed updating the Federal Testing Procedures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/OMS/sftp.htm |title=Federal Test Procedure Revisions |date=October 22, 1996 |website=EPA.gov|access-date=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; to add a new higher-speed test (US06) and an air-conditioner-on test (SC03) to further improve the correlation of fuel economy and emission estimates with real-world reports. In December 2006 the updated testing methodology was finalized to be implemented in model year 2008 vehicles and set the precedent of a 12-year review cycle for the test procedures.&lt;ref name=&quot;epafe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/420f06069.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907013023/http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/420f06069.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 7, 2008 |title=EPA Fuel Economy |publisher=EPA.gov |date= |access-date=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, EPA launched a program called &quot;Your MPG&quot; that allows drivers to add real-world fuel economy statistics into a database on the EPA's fuel economy website and compare them with others and with the original EPA test results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/mpg/MPG.do |title=Welcome to Your MPG!|publisher=FuelEconomy.gov|access-date=October 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA conducts fuel economy tests on very few vehicles. &quot;Just 18 of the EPA's 17,000 employees work in the automobile-testing department in Ann Arbor, Michigan, examining 200 to 250 vehicles a year, or roughly 15 percent of new models. As to that other 85 percent, the EPA takes automakers at their word—without any testing-accepting submitted results as accurate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q3/the_truth_about_epa_city_highway_mpg_estimates-feature |title=The Truth About EPA City / Highway MPG Estimates |date=August 2009 |author=Dave Vanderwerp |website=CarAndDriver.com |access-date=August 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821232506/http://www.caranddriver.com/features/09q3/the_truth_about_epa_city_highway_mpg_estimates-feature |archivedate=August 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two-thirds of the vehicles the EPA tests themselves are randomly selected and the remaining third is tested for specific reasons.

Although originally created as a reference point for fossil-fueled vehicles, [[driving cycle]]s have been used for estimating how many miles an electric vehicle will get on a single charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Chuck Squatriglia |url=https://www.wired.com/autopia/2010/11/honda-finds-evs-a-perfect-fit |title=Honda Finds EVs a Perfect Fit &amp;#124; Autopia |publisher=Wired.com |date=November 17, 2010|access-date=March 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil spill prevention program===
EPA's oil spill prevention program includes the Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure (SPCC) and the Facility Response Plan (FRP) rules. The SPCC Rule applies to all facilities that store, handle, process, gather, transfer, refine, distribute, use or consume oil or oil products. Oil products includes petroleum and non-petroleum oils as well as: animal fats, oils and greases; fish and marine mammal oils; and vegetable oils. It mandates a written plan for facilities that store more than 1,320 gallons of fuel above ground or more than 42,000 gallons below-ground, and which might discharge to navigable waters (as defined in the [[Clean Water Act]]) or adjoining shorelines. [[Secondary spill containment]] is mandated at oil storage facilities and oil release containment is required at oil development sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/oil-spills-prevention-and-preparedness-regulations |title=Oil Spills Prevention and Preparedness Regulations |date= March 7, 2017 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxics Release Inventory===
The [[Toxics Release Inventory]] (TRI) is a resource established by the [[Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act]] specifically for the public to learn about toxic chemical releases and pollution prevention activities reported by industrial and federal facilities&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;. TRI data support informed decision-making by communities, government agencies, companies, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/toxics-release-inventory-tri-program |title=Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) Program |publisher=EPA |publication-date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Annually, the agency collects data from more than 20,000 facilities&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;. The EPA has generated a range of tools to support the use of this inventory, including interactive maps and online databases such as ChemView&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;.

===WaterSense===
[[WaterSense]] is an EPA program launched in June 2006 to encourage [[water efficiency]] in the [[United States]] through the use of a special [[label]] on [[consumer]] [[Product (business)|products]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Washington, DC. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/about_us/timeline.html &quot;WaterSense Timeline.&quot;] Revised April 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Products include high-efficiency toilets (HETs), bathroom sink faucets (and accessories), and irrigation equipment. WaterSense is a [[wikt:voluntary|voluntary]] program, with EPA developing specifications for water-efficient products through a public process and product testing by independent laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [http://www.epa.gov/watersense/news/archive/2006.htm &quot;WaterSense.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground Storage Tanks Program ===
EPA regulates underground storage tanks (USTs) containing petroleum and hazardous chemicals under Subtitle I of the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act|Solid Waste Disposal Act]]. This program was launched in 1985 and covers about 553,000 active USTs. Since 1984, 1.8 million USTs have been closed in compliance with regulations&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;. 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico manage UST programs with EPA authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/ust/ust-program-facts |title=UST Program Facts |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=May 2018 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the program began, EPA had only 90 staff to develop a system to regulate more than 2 million tanks and work with 750,000 owners and operators. Administrator Lee Thomas told the program’s new manager, Ron Brand, that it would have to be done differently that EPA’s traditional approach. This program therefore behaves differently than other EPA offices, focusing much more on local operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/602BCE06FAFAB29B.pdf#page=2|title=Transcript of ‘The Underground Storage Tank Program’s Early Management Challenges’ video|last=Brand|first=Ron|date=April 24, 2013|website=EPA Alumni Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily implemented by states, tribes, and territories&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;. Today, the program supports the inspection of all federally regulated tanks, cleans up old and new leaks, minimizes potential leaks, and encourages sustainable reuse of abandoned gas stations&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;.

===Drinking Water===
EPA ensures safe [[drinking water]] for the public, by setting standards for more than 160,000 [[public water system]]s nationwide. EPA oversees states, local governments and water suppliers to enforce the standards under the [[Safe Drinking Water Act]]. The program includes regulation of [[injection well]]s in order to protect underground sources of drinking water. Select readings of amounts of certain contaminants in drinking water, precipitation, and surface water, in addition to milk and air, are reported on EPA's Rad Net web site&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radnet/ EPA&lt;/ref&gt; in a section entitled Envirofacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/erams_query_v2.simple_query Envirofacts EPA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024153056/http://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/erams_query_v2.simple_query |date=October 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA recommended that intervention was not necessary until drinking water was contaminated with radioactive iodine 131 at a concentration of 81,000 picocuries per liter (the limit for short term exposure set by the International Atomic Energy Agency), which was 27,000 times the prior EPA limit of 3 picocuries per liter for long term exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA relaxes regulations&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffmcmahon/2013/04/10/epa-draft-stirs-fears-of-radically-relaxed-radiation-guidelines/ |title=EPA Draft Stirs Fears of Radically Relaxed Radiation Guidelines |publisher=Forbes|author=Jeff McMahon|date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System===
{{see also|United States regulation of point source water pollution}}
The [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES) permit program addresses [[water pollution]] by regulating [[point source]]s which discharge to US waters. Created in 1972 by the Clean Water Act, the NPDES permit program authorizes state governments to perform its many permitting, administrative, and enforcement aspects.&lt;ref name=&quot;About NPDES&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/about-npdes |title=About NPDES |date=November 29, 2016 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, EPA has approved 47 states to administer all or portions of the permit program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=NPDES State Program Information |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2018-08-20 |website=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA regional offices manage the program in the remaining areas of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;About NPDES&quot;/&gt; The Water Quality Act of 1987 extended NPDES permit coverage to [[industrial stormwater]] dischargers and municipal separate storm sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;Clean Water Act section 402(p); {{USC|33|1342(p)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, there were 6,700 major point source NPDES permits in place and 109,000 municipal and industrial point sources with general or individual permits&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;.

=== RCRA Corrective Action ===
This program is a federal and state cleanup program. Established by RCRA, it requires that facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous wastes investigate and clean up hazardous releases at their own expense&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;. For this purpose, the EPA has developed guidance and policy to assist facilities. It is largely implemented through permits and orders&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/hw/learn-about-corrective-action|title=Learn about Corrective Action|last=US EPA|first=OSWER|date=2016-01-22|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2016, the program has led to the cleanup of 18 million acres of land, of which facilities were primarily responsible for cleanup costs&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;. The goal of EPA and states is to complete final remedies by 2020 at 3,779 priority facilities out of 6,000 that need to be cleaned up according to the program&lt;ref name=&quot;:4&quot; /&gt;.

===Radiation Protection===

===Tools for Schools===
EPA's Indoor Air Quality Tools for Schools Program helps schools to maintain a healthy environment and reduce exposures to indoor environmental contaminants. It helps school personnel identify, solve, and prevent indoor air quality problems in the school environment. Through the use of a multi-step management plan and checklists for the entire building, schools can lower their students' and staff's risk of exposure to asthma triggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/iaq-schools/indoor-air-quality-tools-schools-action-kit |title=Creating Healthy Indoor Air Quality in Schools &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date=November 28, 2016 |accessdate=March 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental education===
The [[National Environmental Education Act]] of 1990 requires EPA to provide national leadership to increase environmental literacy. EPA established the Office of Environmental Education to implement this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/education |title=Environmental Education (EE) &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date=August 16, 2016 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clean School Bus USA===
Clean School Bus USA is a national partnership to reduce children's exposure to diesel exhaust by eliminating unnecessary school bus idling, installing effective emission control systems on newer buses and replacing the oldest buses in the fleet with newer ones. Its goal is to reduce both children's exposure to diesel exhaust and the amount of air pollution created by diesel school buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/cleandiesel/clean-school-bus |title=Clean School Bus &amp;#124; Clean Diesel and DERA Funding &amp;#124; US EPA |website=Epa.gov |date=October 24, 2016 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Green Chemistry Program ===
This program encourages the development of products and processes that follow green chemistry principles&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;. It has recognized more than 100 winning technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/greenchemistry/information-about-green-chemistry-challenge|title=Information about the Green Chemistry Challenge|last=US EPA|first=OCSPP|date=2013-02-13|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These reduce the use or creation of hazardous chemicals, save water, and reduce greenhouse gas release&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;.

=== Section 404 Program ===
This permit program regulates the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States. Permits are to be denied if they would cause unacceptable degradation or if an alternative doesn't exist that does not also have adverse impacts on waters&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;. Permit holders are typically required to restore or create wetlands or other waters to offset losses that can't be avoided.

=== State Revolving Loan Fund Program ===
This program replaced the Construction Grants Program, which was phased out in 1990. This program distributes grants to states which, along with matching state funds, are loaned to municipalities for wastewater infrastructure at below-market interest rates&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;. These loans are expected to be paid back, creating revolving loan funds. Through 2014, a total of $36.2 billion in capitalization grants from the EPA have been provided to the states' revolving funds&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;.

=== Beach Program ===
Established by a 2000 amendment to the [[Clean Water Act]], the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health (BEACH) Act, this program was established for specific attention to be paid to the coastal recreational waters, and required the EPA to develop criteria to test and monitor waters and notify public users of any concerns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/beach-tech/about-beach-act|title=About the BEACH Act|last=US EPA|first=OW|date=2013-02-28|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The program involves states, local beach resource managers, and the agency in assessing risks of stormwater and wastewater overflows and enables better sampling, analytical methods, and communication with the public&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;.

=== Geographic Programs ===
The EPA has also established specific programs for particular water resources such as the Chesapeake Bay Program, National Estuaries Program, and Gulf of Mexico Program&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;.

=== Construction Grants Program (Past) ===
This program distributed federal grants for the construction of municipal wastewater treatment works from 1972 to 1990. While such grants existed before the passage of the Clean Water Act of 1972, it expanded these grants dramatically. They were distributed through 1990, when the program and funding were replaced with the State Revolving Loan Fund Program&lt;ref name=&quot;:5&quot; /&gt;.

=== 33/50 Program (Past) ===
In 1991 under Administrator William Reilly, the EPA implemented its voluntary 33/50 program&lt;ref&gt;Former Deputy Administrator Hank Habicht talks about management at EPA. An Interview with Hank Habicht [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=17 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60772C611F145A4D.pdf#page=7 Transcript] (see p7). December 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. This was designed to encourage, recognize, and celebrate companies that voluntarily found ways to prevent and reduce pollution in their operations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/oppt/3350/web/pdf/3350-fnl.pdf|title=33/50 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=EPA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Specifically, it challenged industry to reduce Toxic Release Inventory emissions of 17 priority chemicals by 33% in one year and 50% in four years&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;. These results were achieved before the commitment deadlines&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;.

=== 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program (Past) ===
Launched in 2006, this voluntary program worked with eight major companies to voluntarily reduce their global emissions of certain types of perfluorinated chemicals by 95% by 2010 and eliminate these emissions by 2015&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/fact-sheet-20102015-pfoa-stewardship-program|title=Fact Sheet: 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program|last=US EPA|first=OCSPP|date=2016-05-10|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical Data Reporting ==
When the [[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976|Toxic Substances Control Act]] was passed in 1976, it required the EPA to create and maintain a national inventory of all existing chemicals in U.S. commerce. When the act was passed, there were more than 60,000 chemicals on the market that had never been comprehensively cataloged. To do so, the EPA developed and implemented procedures that have served as a model for Canada, Japan, and the European Union. For the inventory, the EPA also established a baseline for new chemicals that the agency should be notified about before being commercially manufactured. Today, this rule keeps the EPA updated on volumes, uses, and exposures of around 7,000 of the highest-volume chemicals via industry reporting.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

==Environmental Justice==
The EPA has been criticized for its lack of progress towards [[environmental justice]]. Administrator [[Christine Todd Whitman]] was criticized for her changes to President Bill Clinton's [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] 12898 during 2001, removing the requirements for government agencies to take the poor and minority populations into special consideration when making changes to environmental legislation, and therefore defeating the spirit of the Executive Order.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neil report&quot;&gt;O'Neil, S. G. (2007). [http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/9903/9903.pdf Superfund: Evaluating the Impact of Executive Order 12898] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326091757/http://www.ehponline.org/members/2007/9903/9903.pdf |date=March 26, 2009 }}. Environmental Health Perspectives, Volume 115, Number 7, pp. 1087–93&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2004 report, the [[Office of the Inspector General|inspector general]] of the agency concluded that the EPA &quot;has not developed a clear vision or a comprehensive strategic plan, and has not established values, goals, expectations, and performance measurements&quot; for environmental justice in its daily operations. Another report in September 2006 found the agency still had failed to review the success of its programs, policies and activities towards environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Robert |last=Bullard |title= Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Regarding Environmental Justice |date=July 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found that poor and minority populations were underserved by the EPA's [[Superfund]] program, and that this situation was worsening.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Neil report&quot;/&gt;

===Barriers to enforcing environmental justice===
{{Original research|section|date=March 2017}}
Many environmental justice issues are local, and therefore difficult to address by a federal agency, such as the EPA. Without strong media attention, political interest, or 'crisis' status, local issues are less likely to be addressed at the federal level compared to larger, well publicized incidents.

Conflicting political powers in successive administrations: The White House maintains direct control over the EPA, and its enforcements are subject to the political agenda of who is in power. Republicans and Democrats differ in their approaches to environmental justice. While President Bill Clinton signed the executive order 12898, the Bush administration did not develop a clear plan or establish goals for integrating environmental justice into everyday practices, affecting the motivation for environmental enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert. ''Growing Smarter: Achieving Livable Communities, Environmental Justice, and Regional Equity''. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

The EPA is responsible for preventing and detecting environmental crimes, informing the public of environmental enforcement, and setting and monitoring standards of air pollution, water pollution, hazardous wastes and chemicals. &quot;It is difficult to construct a specific mission statement given its wide range of responsibilities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, W. A. &quot;Still reforming after all these years: George W. Bush's new era' at the EPA. Environmental Policy: New directions for the Twenty-first century. Washington DC: [[CQ Press]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}} It is impossible to address every environmental crime adequately or efficiently if there is no specific mission statement to refer to. The EPA answers to various groups, competes for resources, and confronts a wide array of harms to the environment. All of these present challenges, including a lack of resources, its self-policing policy, and a broadly defined legislation that creates too much discretion for EPA officers.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Ronald G. Michael J. Lynch, and Paul Stretesky. Environmental Law, Crime, and Justice. New York: LFB Scholarly publishing Inc, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2017}}

The EPA &quot;does not have the authority or resources to address injustices without an increase in federal mandates&quot; requiring private industries to consider the environmental ramifications of their activities.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Justice Coalition (EJC). &quot;Environmental Justice act of 2009.&quot; Environmental Justice Coalition, 2008.

==Research vessel, 2004–2013==
[[File:OSV Bold.jpg|thumb|[[USNS Bold (T-AGOS-12)|OSV ''Bold'']] docked at [[Port Canaveral, Florida]]]]

In March 2004, the U.S. Navy transferred [[USNS Bold (T-AGOS-12)]], a [[Stalwart class ocean surveillance ship|''Stalwart'' class ocean surveillance ship]], to the EPA. The ship had been used in anti-submarine operations during the [[Cold War]], was equipped with sidescan sonar, underwater video, water and sediment sampling instruments used in study of ocean and coastline. One of the major missions of the ''Bold'' was to monitor for ecological impact sites where materials were dumped from dredging operations in U.S. ports.&lt;ref name=&quot;bold brochure&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/owow/osvbold/brochure.html|title=About the OSV Bold |publisher=EPA |page=EPA 842-F-05-004|accessdate=January 17, 2009|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224070656/http://www.epa.gov/owow/osvbold/brochure.html|archivedate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[General Services Administration]] sold the ''Bold'' to [[Seattle Central Community College]] (SCCC), which demonstrated in a competition that they would put it to the highest and best purpose, at a nominal cost of $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long |first=Katherine |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021743030_sccvesselxml.html |title=What a $5,000 deal: Seattle Central gets former Navy ship &amp;#124; Local News |publisher=The Seattle Times |date= |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012042420/https://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2021743030_sccvesselxml.html |archivedate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advance identification==
Advance identification, or ADID, is a planning process used by the EPA to identify wetlands and other bodies of water and their respective suitability for the discharge of dredged and fill material. The EPA conducts the process in cooperation with the U.S. [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] and local states or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American Tribes]]. As of February 1993, 38 ADID projects had been completed and 33 were ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/OWOW/wetlands/facts/fact28.html |title=EPA – Wetlands – Wetlands Fact Sheet |publisher=Epa.gov |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies (1983–present)==
[[File:EPA HQ - WJ Clinton Building - Main entrance - 2018a.jpg|thumb|right|EPA headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

===Fiscal mismanagement, 1983===
In 1982 Congress charged that the EPA had mishandled the $1.6 billion program to clean up hazardous waste dumps [[Superfund]] and demanded records from EPA director [[Anne Gorsuch Burford|Anne M. Gorsuch]]. She refused and became the first agency director in U.S. history to be cited for [[contempt of Congress]]. The EPA turned the documents over to Congress several months later, after the White House abandoned its court claim that the documents could not be subpoenaed by Congress because they were covered by [[executive privilege]]. At that point, Gorsuch resigned her post, citing pressures caused by the media and the congressional investigation.&lt;ref name=toledoblade&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=73gUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=swIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6140,3000792&amp;dq=anne+mcgill+gorsuch+held+in+contempt+of+congress &quot;Burford Resigns As Administrator of Embattled EPA&quot;], Toledo Blade, March 10, 1983, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Critics charged that the EPA was in a shambles at that time.&lt;ref name=spokanechronicle&gt;Ingersoll, Bruce. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X6YSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e_kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=528,3563248&amp;dq=anne+mcgill+gorsuch+held+in+contempt+of+congress Burford out; agency is in 'a shambles'], ''Spokane Chronicle'', March 10, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; When Lee Thomas came to the agency in 1983 as Acting Assistant Administrator of the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, shortly before Gorsuch's resignation, six congressional committees were investigating the Superfund program. There were also two FBI agents performing an investigation for the Justice Department into possible destruction of documents&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=28 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60740780F5ACB3D5.pdf#page=1 Transcript] (see p4). April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gorsuch, appointed by [[Ronald Reagan]], resigned under fire in 1983. Gorsuch based her administration of the EPA on the [[New Federalism]] approach of downsizing federal agencies by delegating their functions and services to the individual states.&lt;ref name=epajournal&gt;[http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/views-former-administrators#Gorsuch Views from the Former Administrators] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925054739/http://www2.epa.gov/aboutepa/views-former-administrators#Gorsuch |date=September 25, 2015 }}, ''EPA Journal'', November 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed that the EPA was over-regulating business and that the agency was too large and not cost-effective. During her 22 months as agency head, she cut the budget of the EPA by 22%, reduced the number of cases filed against polluters, relaxed Clean Air Act regulations, and facilitated the spraying of restricted-use pesticides. She cut the total number of agency employees, and hired staff from the industries they were supposed to be regulating.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;Sullivan, Patricia. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3418-2004Jul21.html Anne Gorsuch Burford, 62, Dies; Reagan EPA Director], ''Washington Post'', July 22, 2004; Page B06.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmentalism|Environmentalists]] contended that her policies were designed to placate polluters, and accused her of trying to dismantle the agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Douglas Martin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/22/us/anne-gorsuch-burford-62-reagan-epa-chief-dies.html |title=Anne Gorsuch Burford, 62, Reagan E.P.A.

=== TSCA and confidential business information, 1994 (or earlier)–present ===
[[Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976|TSCA]] enables the EPA to require industry to conduct testing of chemicals, but the agency must balance this with obligations to provide information to the public and ensure the protection of trade secrets and confidential business information (the legal term for proprietary information). Arising issues and problems from these overlapping obligations have been the subject of multiple critical reports by the [[Government Accountability Office]]. How much information the agency should have access to from industry, how much it should keep confidential, and how much it should reveal to the public is still contested. For example, according to TSCA, state officials are not allowed access to confidential business information collected by the EPA.&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot; /&gt;

===Political pressure and scientific integrity, 2001–present===
In April 2008, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] said that more than half of the nearly 1,600 EPA staff scientists who responded online to a detailed questionnaire reported they had experienced incidents of political interference in their work. The survey included chemists, toxicologists, engineers, geologists and experts in other fields of science. About 40% of the scientists reported that the interference had been more prevalent in the last five years than in previous years. The highest number of complaints came from scientists who were involved in determining the risks of cancer by chemicals used in food and other aspects of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Meddling at EPA? Activists point to survey; Two thirds of 1,586 EPA scientists polled cite interference, UCS reports |agency=Associated Press |date=April 23, 2008 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24276709/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPA research has also been suppressed by career managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stedeford |first=Todd |year=2007 |title=Prior restraint and censorship: acknowledged occupational hazards for government scientists |journal=William and Mary Environmental Law and Policy Review |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=725–745 |url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmelpr/vol31/iss3/4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supervisors at EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment required several paragraphs to be deleted from a peer-reviewed journal article about EPA's [[integrated risk information system]], which led two co-authors to have their names removed from the publication, and the corresponding author, Ching-Hung Hsu, to leave EPA &quot;because of the draconian restrictions placed on publishing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stedeford|2007|loc=p. 738, note 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA subjects employees who author scientific papers to [[prior restraint]], even if those papers are written on personal time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stedeford|2007|pp=736–740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Government Accountability Office]] stated that the EPA violated federal law with covert propaganda on their social media platforms. The social media messaging that was used promoted materials supporting the [[Waters of the United States Regulatory Overreach Protection Act of 2014|Waters of the United States]] rule, including materials that were designed to oppose legislative efforts to limit or block the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=GAO hits EPA for 'covert propaganda' to promote 'waters of the United States' (WOTUS) rule|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/12/15/gao-hits-epa-for-covert-propaganda-to-promote-waters-of-the-united-states-wotus-rule/|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 15, 2015|access-date=December 16, 2015|issn=0190-8286|language=English|first=Jonathan H.|last=Adler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, U.S. Representative [[Matt Gaetz]] (R-Fla.) sponsored [[H.R. 861 (115th Congress)|H.R. 861]], a bill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/861/|title=H.R. 861|publisher=United States Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; to abolish the EPA by 2018. According to Gaetz, &quot;The American people are drowning in rules and regulation promulgated by unelected bureaucrats. And the Environmental Protection Agency has become an extraordinary offender.&quot; The bill was co-sponsored by [[Thomas Massie]] (R-Ky.), [[Steven Palazzo]] (R-Ms.) and [[Barry Loudermilk]] (R-Ga.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hensley|first1=Nicole |title=Florida congressman pitches bill that would abolish the Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/fla-lawmaker-pitches-bill-abolish-epa-article-1.2965042|accessdate=January 6, 2017 |publisher=New York Daily News|date=February 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuel economy, 2005–2010===
In July 2005, an EPA report showing that auto companies were using loopholes to produce less fuel-efficient cars was delayed. The report was supposed to be released the day before a controversial energy bill was passed and would have provided backup for those opposed to it, but the EPA delayed its release at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/28/business/28fuel.html |title=E.P.A.

After the federal government had bailed out [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] in the [[Automotive industry crisis of 2008–2010]], the 2010 [[Chevrolet Equinox]] was released with an EPA fuel economy rating abnormally higher than its competitors.

===Mercury emissions, 2005===
In March 2005, nine states (California, New York, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut, New Mexico and Vermont) sued the EPA. The EPA's [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|Inspector General]] had determined that the EPA's regulation of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] emissions did not follow the Clean Air Act, and that the regulations were influenced by top political appointees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A64630-2004Jan30 Proposed Mercury Rules Bear Industry Mark], ''Washington Post'', January 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A61762-2005Feb3.html EPA Inspector Finds Mercury Proposal Tainted], ''Washington Post'', February 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA had suppressed a study it commissioned by [[Harvard University]] which contradicted its position on mercury controls.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55268-2005Mar21.html New EPA Mercury Rule Omits Conflicting Data], ''Washington Post'', March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The suit alleged that the EPA's rule exempting coal-fired power plants from &quot;maximum available control technology&quot; was illegal, and additionally charged that the EPA's system of [[cap-and-trade]] to lower average mercury levels would allow power plants to forego reducing mercury emissions, which they objected would lead to dangerous local hotspots of mercury contamination even if average levels declined.&lt;ref name=Bustillo2005&gt;Bustillo, Miguel.[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/30/local/me-mercury30 States Sue EPA Over Mercury Emissions], ''LA Times'', March 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Several states also began to enact their own mercury emission regulations. Illinois's proposed rule would have reduced mercury emissions from power plants by an average of 90% by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.state.il.us/environmental-progress/v32/n1/environmental-progress.pdf Governor Blagojevich and Illinois EPA Propose Aggressive Mercury Controls For Illinois Power Plants], ''Environmental Progress'', Spring 2006, page 12&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008—by which point a total of fourteen states had joined the suit—the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the EPA regulations violated the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baltimore2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baltimore|first1=Chris|title=EPA must rewrite utility mercury rule: U.S. court|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/environment-usa-utilities-mercury-dc-idUSN0847678520080208|accessdate=February 1, 2017|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=February 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, EPA announced plans to propose such standards to replace the vacated Clean Air Mercury Rule, and did so on March 16, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPA_MATS2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the MATS Regulation|url=https://www.epa.gov/mats/history-mats-regulation |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change, 2007–2017===

{{wikinews|EPA proposes using Clean Air Act to fight global warming}}

In December 2007, EPA Administrator Stephen L. Johnson approved a draft of a document that declared that climate change imperiled the public welfare—a decision that would trigger the first national mandatory global-warming regulations. Associate Deputy Administrator Jason Burnett e-mailed the draft to the White House. White House aides—who had long resisted mandatory regulations as a way to address climate change—knew the gist of what Johnson's finding would be, Burnett said. They also knew that once they opened the attachment, it would become a public record, making it controversial and difficult to rescind. So they did not open it; rather, they called Johnson and asked him to take back the draft. Johnson rescinded the draft; in July 2008, he issued a new version which did not state that [[global warming]] was danger to public welfare. Burnett resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=An Eroding Mission at EPA; The Bush administration has weakened the agency charged with safeguarding health and the environment |author=John Shiffman and John Sullivan |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=December 7, 2008 |url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20081207_An_Eroding_Mission_at_EPA.html?viewAll=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A $3 million mapping study on [[Climate Change Science Program#Coastal sensitivity to sea level rise (SAP 4.1)|''sea level rise'']] was suppressed by EPA management during both the Bush and Obama Administrations, and managers changed a key interagency report to reflect the removal of the maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|author=Josh Harkinson and Kate Sheppard|title=Coastal Collapse |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2252063|accessdate=June 1, 2010|magazine=Slate|date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2017, multiple climate change subdomains at EPA.gov began redirecting to a notice stating &quot;this page is being updated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/28/epa-website-removes-climate-science-site-from-public-view-after-two-decades/|title=EPA website removes climate science site from public view after two decades|date=April 29, 2017|website=Washington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA issued a statement announcing the overhaul of its website to &quot;reflect the agency's new direction under President Donald Trump and Administrator Scott Pruitt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-kicks-website-updates|title=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, “EPA Kicks Off Website Updates,” (April 28, 2017)|date=April 28, 2017|website=EPA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removed EPA climate change domains included extensive information on the EPA's work to mitigate climate change, as well as details of data collection efforts and indicators for climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100days.envirodatagov.org/changing-digital-climate/|title=Changing the Digital Climate How Climate Change Web Content is being Censored Under the Trump Administration|date=January 10, 2018|website=Environmental Data &amp; Governance Initiative (EDGI)|access-date=July 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold King Mine waste water spill, 2015===
In August 2015, the [[2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill]] occurred when EPA contractors examined the level of pollutants such as [[lead]] and [[arsenic]] in a [[Colorado]] mine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/epa-causes-massive-colorado-spill-1-million-gallons-mining-waste-turns-river-361019|first=Zoë|last=Schlanger|title=EPA Causes Massive Spill of Mining Waste Water in Colorado, Turns Animas River Bright Orange|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accidentally released over three million gallons of waste water into Cement Creek and the [[Animas River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;aug10spillfox&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/08/10/navajo-nation-aims-to-sue-epa-over-devastating-mining-spill/|first=Joseph J.|last=Kolb |title='They're not going to get away with this': Anger mounts at EPA over mining spill|date=August 10, 2015|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collusion with Monsanto chemical company ===
In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), a branch of the [[World Health Organization]], cited research linking [[glyphosate]], an ingredient of the weed killer Roundup manufactured by the chemical company [[Monsanto]], to [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]].  In March 2017, the presiding judge in a litigation brought about by people who claim to have developed glyphosate-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma opened Monsanto emails and other documents related to the case, including email exchanges between the company and federal regulators.  According to an article in the ''New York Times'', the &quot;records suggested that Monsanto had ghostwritten research that was later attributed to academics and indicated that a senior official at the Environmental Protection Agency had worked to quash a review of Roundup’s main ingredient, glyphosate, that was to have been conducted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services.&quot;  The records show that Monsanto was able to prepare &quot;a public relations assault&quot; on the finding after they were alerted to the determination by Jess Rowland, the head of the EPA’s cancer assessment review committee  at that time,  months in advance.  Emails also showed that Rowland &quot;had promised to beat back an effort by the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] to conduct its own review.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakim|first1=Danny|title=Monsanto Weed Killer Roundup Faces New Doubts on Safety in Unsealed Documents|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/business/monsanto-roundup-safety-lawsuit.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yan|first1=Holly|title=Patients: Roundup gave us cancer as EPA official helped the company|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/15/health/roundup-herbicide-cancer-allegations/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Arthur|title=EU declared Monsanto weedkiller safe after intervention from controversial US official|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/may/24/eu-declared-monsanto-weedkiller-safe-after-intervention-from-controversial-us-official|website=The Guardian|accessdate=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chief Scott Pruitt, 2017 ===
On February 17, 2017, [[Scott Pruitt]] was selected [[Administrator of the EPA]] by president [[Donald Trump]]. This was a seemingly controversial move, as Pruitt had spent most of his career countering environmental policy. He did not have previous experience in the field and had received financial support from the fossil fuel industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/epas-scott-pruitt-haunted-corruption-allegations-old-and-new|title=EPA's Scott Pruitt haunted by corruption allegations, old and new|work=MSNBC|access-date=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pruitt resigned from the position on July 5, 2018, citing &quot;unrelenting attacks&quot; due to ongoing ethics controversies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/05/politics/scott-pruitt-epa-resigns/index.html|title=EPA chief Scott Pruitt resigns amid ethics scandals|last=CNN|first=[[Jeremy Diamond (journalist)|Jeremy Diamond]], Eli Watkins and Juana Summers,|work=CNN|access-date=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
