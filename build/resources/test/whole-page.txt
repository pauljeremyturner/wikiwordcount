Following a sequence where they greet the audience and viewers, and introduce the tent, the first feature shows the three presenters testing three [[Hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[hypercar (supercar)|hypercars]]; with Clarkson in the [[McLaren P1]], Hammond in the [[Porsche 918]] and May in the Ferrari [[LaFerrari]] at the [[Algarve International Circuit]] in Portugal. After a series of tests including a drag race (which had no determined winner), a road drive and an electric race (both of which the LaFerrari did not take part in), Jérôme d'Ambrosio performs timed laps in the hypercars. Hammond's Porsche 918 sets the fastest time and both he and May declare that they will demolish Clarkson's house as forfeit for losing a bet: that the McLaren P1 would be fastest in a timed lap and beat the Porsche 918 and LaFerrari. Clarkson introduces the show's new test track, the &quot;Eboladrome&quot; with laps by a [[Ferrari 488]] and then tests a [[BMW M2]] which is then sent round the track by the new test driver &quot;[[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|The American]]&quot;. May is revealed to have been caught speeding in a segment called &quot;Conversation Street&quot;. Jeremy Renner, Armie Hammer and Carol Vorderman are all humorously &quot;killed&quot; before being able to take part in the show in a segment called &quot;Celebrity Brain Crash&quot;.

The presenters discuss President of South Africa [[Jacob Zuma]], the [[Nkandla compound firepool controversy]] and [[carjacking]]. Clarkson tests the [[Aston Martin Vulcan]] at the Eboladrome, followed by a fast lap set by &quot;The American&quot;. Hypercars and Johannesburg are discussed in Conversation Street.

| Aux3            = [[Simon Pegg]]
| ShortSummary    = The tent is on the quayside of Whitby harbour in [[North Yorkshire]]. Clarkson begins by telling the audience &quot;We're home!&quot;, as all three were born or grew up in Yorkshire. The presenters go &quot;[[Grand Tour]]ing&quot; in Italy with May in the [[Rolls-Royce Dawn (2015)|Rolls-Royce Dawn]], Clarkson in the [[Aston Martin DB11]] and Hammond in the [[Dodge Challenger#SRT Hellcat|Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat]]. Clarkson and May's tour starts at the [[Palio di Siena]] horse race, before viewing ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' painting at [[Uffizi Gallery]] in Florence with Hammond acting inappropriately throughout. Clarkson and Hammond race each other the [[Mugello Circuit]] with Clarkson narrowly winning and all three presenters try painting their cars. Hammond visits the [[Lamborghini Museum]] whilst Clarkson and May watch ''[[Carmen]]'' staged at the [[Verona Arena]], in the [[Piazza Bra]]. The tour continues via the [[Piazza dei Signori, Vicenza]], where Clarkson and May abandon Hammond in the Crowds and ends up in [[Venice]] where Hammond causes Clarkson and May to fall into the [[Venetian Lagoon]]. The presenters discuss Whitby [[jet (lignite)|jet]] in Conversation Street. [[Simon Pegg]] &quot;falls to his death&quot; from [[Whitby Swing Bridge]]. Clarkson presents his take on automated vehicles. Fulfilling their bet from episode one, Hammond and May destroy Clarkson's house at Diddly Squat Farm in [[Chadlington]], Oxfordshire.&lt;ref group=&quot;n&quot;&gt;This actually happened. The team demolished Clarkson's Oxfordshire home, which was scheduled for demolition, and filmed it for ''The Grand Tour''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/09/jeremy-clarkson-blows-up-his-old-home-to-make-way-for-new-cotswo|title=Jeremy Clarkson blows up old home to make way for new Cotswold farmhouse|publisher=Telegraph.co.uk|date=9 September 2016|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Aux3            = [[Jimmy Carr]]
| ShortSummary    = The tent remains on the quayside of Whitby harbour in [[North Yorkshire]]. Clarkson reviews the [[Porsche 911 GT3#991.1 GT3 RS|Porsche 911 GT3 RS]] and compares it to the [[BMW M4#F82 M4 GTS|BMW M4 GTS]] at the Eboladrome; despite criticising the M4 GTS for sacrificing creature comforts for no overall gain in performance, he declares it the winner simply because Hammond owns a GT3 RS. The Porsche is revealed to be two seconds faster than the BMW following Laps set by &quot;The American&quot;. In Conversation Street the Constabulary of Whitby are discussed. The presenters travel to South [[Wales]] and set out to make the most environmentally friendly car bodies using the platform of a [[Land Rover Discovery#First generation|Land Rover Discovery]]. They take an 11-mile road trip to a dirt track, where they race against three normal cars. The idea of environmentally friendly car bodies is abandoned after Clarkson's meat car is infested with maggots, Hammond's garden car catches fire, and May's mud and hay car falls apart. Jimmy Carr is the guest of &quot;Celebrity Brain Crash&quot;, but his jet ski collides with a boat on his way to the tent. To fill in the time, the presenters introduce an [[Audi TT#TT Mk1 (Typ 8N, 1998–2006)|Audi TT Mk1 Quattro]] with Hammond hidden behind the rear bumper to show a new smuggling technique used by illegal immigrants, as well as using Hammond as an improvised parking sensor.

| Aux3            = [[Golden Earring]]
| ShortSummary    = The tent is at the [[Port of Rotterdam]]. To settle an argument over the best affordable roadster, the presenters go to [[Marrakesh|Marrakech]], [[Morocco]] with Hammond in a [[Mazda MX-5 (ND)|Mazda MX-5]], May in a [[Zenos E10#Zenos E10 S|Zenos E10S]] and Clarkson in an [[Alfa Romeo 4C#Alfa Romeo 4C Spider|Alfa Romeo 4C Spider]]. During the road trip Clarkson suddenly pulls over due to a leg cramp while driving the 4C. Later, he challenges Hammond and May to weigh their cars to prove that the 4C is lighter, using an improvised scale and animal carcasses as counterweight. The scale breaks just as Hammond is about to remove the MX-5 from it, and the crew are ordered to leave the premises due to their use of animal carcasses. Clarkson and the film crew leave Hammond and May to focus on the 4C. The presenters stop at [[Atlas Corporation Studios]] in [[Ouarzazate]] to perform timed laps with their cars. Hammond wins, despite crashing into an Egyptian statue prop. The Dutch Police and Dutch traditions are discussed in Conversation Street. Hammond and May play an explosive game of [[Battleship (game)|Battleships]] using old cars as the &quot;ships&quot; and several [[REVAi|G-Wizes]] as &quot;missiles&quot;. Dutch band Golden Earring perform live outside the tent, but are electrocuted on stage. To fill in the time, Clarkson uses a V-8 engine to inflate a [[Sex doll|blow-up doll]].

| ShortSummary    = The tent is at the forests of Saariselkä. At the [[Port of London]], Hammond welcomes the new right-hand-drive [[Ford Mustang (sixth generation)|Ford Mustang GT]] and gives it a tour of London and [[Stonehenge]] before Clarkson arrives and proceeds to argue that Mustang has no place in Britain and that the [[Ford Focus (third generation)#Focus RS|Ford Focus RS]] is a better option. This escalates to a chase between both cars up to [[Cheddar Gorge]]. The Mustang beats the Focus in a drag race, but is slower around the Eboladrome when driven by &quot;The American&quot;. In &quot;Conversation Street&quot;, Clarkson and May debate over which confectionery creates more mess in a car – a [[Flake (chocolate bar)|Flake]] or a [[Double Decker (chocolate bar)|Double Decker]]. A person introduced as a drunk [[Kimi Räikkönen]]{{refn|name=&quot;neither-credited-or-identifable&quot;|group=&quot;n&quot;}} arrives outside the tent for &quot;Celebrity Brain Crash&quot;, but collapses from drinking too much vodka and is left to die in the arctic temperatures. To fill in the time, the presenters introduce their &quot;Santaland Grotto&quot;, where they talk about their Christmas gift ideas, mostly consisting of everyday items emblazoned with car-manufacturer logos. May introduces Bob Geldof via [[tablet computer|tablet]] on a [[Double Robotics|Double]] [[Telerobotics|telerobot]]. He then talks about the historic [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] rivalry between [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[Ferrari]], which gave birth to the [[Ford GT40]] and the [[Ferrari 330P3|Ferrari P3]].

| ShortSummary    = The presenters are set a challenge by their producer, Andy Wilman, who wishes to show that [[Dune buggy|beach buggies]] are poor vehicles. Their challenge is to drive {{convert|1000|mi|km|sigfig=2|spell=in}} along Namibia's [[Skeleton Coast]] in three beach buggies, each built to their personal specifications but all derived from the [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. Clarkson's buggy is fitted with a  [[Rover V8 engine|V8]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grandtournation.com/thegrandtour/clarkson-hammond-or-may-who-built-the-best-dune-buggy-for-the-namibia-special-mh1211/ Clarkson, Hammond or May: Who Built the Best Dune Buggy for the Namibia Special?]&lt;/ref&gt; May had his the same way as it was out of the kit parts boxes where it ran with a original Beetle air-cooled engine and components while Hammond's buggy is tricked out with rally grade suspensions and off-road tires. After 36 hours of going nowhere, the presenters camp by the shipwreck of ''[[Eduard Bohlen]]'' before venturing to the [[Namib Desert]]. The trio climb and descend several dunes and travel through harsh terrain before finally reaching a road. Clarkson's buggy breaks down and is abandoned by Hammond and May, who arrive in [[Windhoek]] to have a beer while Clarkson struggles with overheating problems on his way to town.

| ShortSummary    = The presenters are reunited, as Clarkson finally arrives in Windhoek to meet up with Hammond and May and prepare for the second leg of their journey to the Namibia-[[Angola]] border. The rough road takes its toll on Clarkson and May's buggies until May suggests they continue off-road, which ends up being worse terrain and they end up in softer sand before returning to the road. After the trio sets camp, May attempts to sabotage Clarkson's buggy when he accidentally sets fire to the front end of his own car. With a third of a mile away from the border, the presenters create a cable car line to cross through a crocodile infested river. Clarkson and May cross successfully, but Hammond is stuck within 200 metres from the goal. Because of this, Clarkson concludes that their failure has proven Wilman right.

The German speeding laws are discussed in Conversation Street. Clarkson fuses the body of a 1978 [[MGB Roadster]] with the chassis of a [[Land Rover Discovery#First generation|Land Rover Discovery]] to make a &quot;proper&quot; [[sport utility vehicle]], but when the MG body falls off, he replaces it with a 1980s [[Mercedes-Benz R107 and C107|Mercedes-Benz SL]] and christens it &quot;The Excellent&quot;. He then gives Hammond and May a ride in it to the [[Cobham Training Centre]] of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea Football Club]] before having it displayed at the Coys of Kensington car auction, where it fetches £4,000 (it cost £14,000 to make).

| ShortSummary    = The tent is on the shore of Loch Ness. Hammond test drives the new [[Abarth 124 Spider|Fiat Abarth 124 Spider]] at the Eboladrome and &quot;The American&quot; then sets a slow Lap in the wet. Cars designed by women are discussed in Conversation Street. To prove that a second-hand [[Maserati]] priced under £8,000 is a better buy than a used [[Ford Focus]], the presenters travel to [[Circuit de Croix-en-Ternois]] in France for a series of tests with Clarkson's [[Maserati Biturbo#Biturbo|Biturbo S Coupé]], Hammond's [[Maserati Biturbo#430|430 Saloon]], and May's [[Maserati Biturbo#The spyders (Tipo AM333)|Zagato Spyder]]. Because May injured his right arm prior to the challenge, he bought an automatic variant. The presenters then embark on a road trip through Northern France before racing back to England via the [[Port of Le Havre]], with the loser selling his Maserati. Clarkson's Biturbo dies, but he continues the race with it on a tow truck. He reaches the ferry port, but discovers that his Biturbo fell off the tow truck while chasing Hammond. May launches his Spyder toward a boat and crashes in spectacular fashion. The presenters conclude that buying a second-hand Maserati will result in a 66% chance of it working. For &quot;Celebrity Brain Crash&quot;, Chris Hoy rows toward the tent, but his boat hits an underwater mine. To fill in the time, Clarkson uses a Bulgarian man to demonstrate a new hands-free system for any car and a Thai woman as an inexpensive massaging back seat.

| ShortSummary    = The tent remains at the west end of Loch Ness because Hammond and May are convinced that the [[Loch Ness Monster]] is deep in the water. Clarkson test drives the [[Lexus GS#2015–present|Lexus GS-F]] at the Eboladrome, driving past many animal-like figures and &quot;The American&quot; sets a Damp Lap Time. The Conversation Street segment sees cars which are becoming extinct. The presenters travel to [[Wank (mountain)|Wank, Germany]], where May in a [[Bentley Bentayga]], Clarkson in a [[Range Rover (L405)|Range Rover]], and Hammond in a [[Jaguar F-Pace]] plan a road trip on the [[Romantic Road]] via [[Kissing, Bavaria]], then [[Petting, Bavaria]], to [[Fucking, Austria]]. After passing [[Landsberg Prison]] and staying overnight in Fucking, Clarkson and Hammond suggest to May that they should skip [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding, Germany]], and head for the [[Nürburgring]] instead. A mistake in the voice recognition of May's navigation system leads them to the Nuremberg [[Norisring]], after which the trio find a quarry to perform timed laps in. Clarkson cheats by climbing a hill and crossing the water to beat Hammond and May's times by two minutes. Tim Burton crosses Loch Ness in a mini-submarine, which implodes before reaching the tent. During the final announcements a mysterious object is seen rising from the loch in the background.

| ShortSummary    = The tent is in Dubai. Clarkson compares his [[Volkswagen Golf Mk7#Golf GTI|Volkswagen Golf GTI]] to May's [[BMW i3]] with a drag race at an airstrip and a road trip from London to [[Dartmoor]] to attend a Roger Daltrey and Wilko Johnson concert. In Conversation Street Dubai's infrastructure is discussed. Clarkson and Hammond make May hang out with &quot;[[Off-roading#Winch events|winchers]]&quot; who drive their 4x4s deep into mud. For &quot;Celebrity Brain Crash&quot;, F1 racer Daniel Ricciardo drives a hovercraft toward the tent, but crashes before being sucked into the hovercraft's fan. Hammond defeats the [[Bugatti Veyron]] in a drag race with the Porsche 918 Spyder, but quickly loses to a 1900 horsepower [[Nissan Patrol#Fifth generation (Y61; 1997–2016)|Nissan Patrol]]. Later, he travels to [[Michelin]]'s proving grounds in France to learn how to drift. He must then prove his skills against two professional drifters – double amputee Bartek Ostałowski and 13-year-old Conor Shanahan – at [[Rockingham Motor Speedway]]. May ends the episode and series with a series of outtakes of Clarkson and Hammond attempting to drift cars.

As Clarkson cannot fit into the Aventador whilst wearing a mandatory [[racing helmet]], Clarkson sends a Lamborghini test driver in his place, thus setting the fastest time of all three. Hammond crashes after completing the course, destroying the Rimac in a fire. Footage taken from [[YouTube]] shows the wreckage being extinguished and Hammond being airlifted by the [[Swiss Air-Rescue]] (REGA) to hospital. The presenters discuss some inappropriate new features within cars on Conversation Street. Celebrity Brain Crash is replaced by Celebrity Face Off, in which [[Ricky Wilson (singer)|Ricky Wilson]] beats [[David Hasselhoff]] to determine who the &quot;fastest former talent show host&quot; is.

Hammond and May attempt to relieve lunchtime boredom by inventing &quot;lunchtime office car park racing&quot; at Houghton Hall [[business park]] in the [[Luton/Dunstable Urban Area]]. After brief interviews in which both share their own ownership of a [[Tesla Model S]], [[Hugh Bonneville]], representing the UK, and [[Casey Anderson (naturalist)|Casey Anderson]], representing the United States, compete during &quot;Celebrity Face Off&quot; as the &quot;fastest person who lives with a bear&quot;, with Anderson winning by setting the faster lap time. Clarkson experiments with the [[jet set]] lifestyle, starting in the morning from the ''Da Vinci'' super-yacht moored in [[Saint-Tropez]] and then driving a [[Bugatti Chiron]] to [[L'Alpe De Venosc]] [[France]] for skiing at lunchtime, stopping briefly for a drag race against a [[BMW M4]] at [[Gap–Tallard Airport]] to give viewers a perspective on how fast the Chiron is. After leaving the Alps, Clarkson then pays an homage to the 1976 film ''[[C'était un rendez-vous]]'', by speeding across [[Turin]] and reaching the Piazza Carignano &lt;small&gt;([[:it:Piazza Carignano|it]])&lt;/small&gt; in 9 minutes.

The presenters begin by having a year-ending awards ceremony in Conversation Street. Hammond heads to the Eboladrome to test the [[McLaren 720S]] after which Eaton sets a lap time.

Hammond tests the [[Lamborghini Huracán#Huracán LP 640-4 Performante (2017-present)|Lamborghini Huracán Performante]] at the Eboladrome beating May's [[Ferrari 458 Speciale]] in a drag race before Eaton takes it round the track setting a fast time. May and Hammond then look at ingenious ways of filling up with fuel instead of stopping at a fuel station. [[Anthony Joshua]] becomes &quot;the fastest man who makes a living out of punching or strangling someone&quot; beating [[Bill Goldberg]], with both previously owning cars from [[General Motors]]. Clarkson then talks about the Rivalry in [[rallying]] between [[Audi]] with the [[Audi Quattro|Quattro]] and [[Lancia]] with the [[Lancia Rally 037|037]]. They conclude with a &quot;terrible disappointment&quot; that Lancia is no longer around.

| ShortSummary    = The presenters head to the City of [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques]], France, and home of the [[Pau Grand Prix]] on the {{ill|Circuit de Pau-Ville|fr}} street course.  At {{ill|Palais Beaumont|fr}} Hammond arrives with a [[Jaguar XKSS|Jagaur XK SS]] and Clarkson in an [[Aston Martin DB4#DB4 GT|Aston Martin DB4 GT]]; both being modern builds of older designs from the 1950s &quot;back-catalogues&quot; of Jaguar and Aston Martin. They both race around the Streets of Pau before May turns up in a modern [[Honda Civic Type R#5th generation (FK8 chassis) (2017–present)|Honda Civic Type R]] to prove that new cars are better. All three depart to drive south over the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, with Clarkson and Hammond experiencing difficulties in dense fog. Clarkson recants a previous incident from 2013—when Clarkson and Hammond's [[driving licence in the United Kingdom|driving licences]] were confiscated whilst filming ''The Perfect Road Trip'' in France—and tries to goad May into speeding on the [[Autopista AP-2]]. At Barcelona the presenters race around the abandoned [[Autódromo de Sitges-Terramar]] and the extreme banking on its corners, with May winning, and Hammond abstaining following his history of crashes. During Conversation Street the presenters discuss names for [[gritter]]s.  At the Eboladrome, Clarkson retests the [[Ford GT#Second generation (2017–present)|Ford GT]] following the Niagara Falls race, with Eaton setting a test lap. [[Nick Mason]] goes on to record a faster lap than [[Stewart Copeland]] to become &quot;the fastest [[drummer]] for a band beginning with [[the letter p]]&quot;.

| ShortSummary    = The presenters discuss new sport cars by various companies, jumpers and the speed of pigeons vs blackbirds during Conversation Street. Clarkson unsuccessfully sets out to prove that mankind has not significantly improved over the last 25 years by testing the [[Jaguar XJ220]] and the [[Bugatti EB 110|Bugatti EB 110 Super Sport]], the fastest supercars from the early 90s, both of which set slow times at the Eboladrome when driven by Eaton. The trio tries to break the UK speed record for [[amphibious vehicle]]s by building one of their own. Clarkson oversees his idea of combining a [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] [[turbofan]] engine from a [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod|Nimrod]] jet and a speedboat with a [[Suzuki Jimny]]. However on a nearby lake, Clarkson and May have to abort their run after achieving only {{convert|3|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and nearly sinking. Hammond and May then go on to build a vehicle of their own by combining a [[Bond Bug]] with the engine of a [[personal water craft]] nicknaming it the &quot;Pond Bug&quot;. Competing on [[Coniston Water]] during Coniston Power Boat Records Week, Clarkson, being the only one with a speedboat licence, operates the &quot;Pond Bug&quot; and achieves an average of {{convert|47.81|mph|km/h|2|abbr=on}}, setting a new UK record. After performing a series of magic tricks, [[Dynamo (magician)|Dynamo]] and [[Penn &amp; Teller]] compete to become &quot;the fastest magician in the world&quot;, with Penn &amp; Teller prevailing on a snowy track.

The presenters head to Canada to prove that small SUV's are useless with Clarkson picking an [[Alfa Romeo Stelvio|Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio]], May choosing a [[Range Rover Velar|Range Rover Velar P380]] and Hammond taking a [[Porsche Macan|Porsche Macan Turbo Performance Pack]]. They are shown to be slower round the Area 27 circuit than a [[BMW M3]], not practical enough to carry Canadian [[Newfoundland dog]]s, and slower round a barrel course than a horse: concluding that SUVs are pointless. Despite this, executive producer [[Andy Wilman]] informs via text that they will race their SUVs whilst each towing a boat up a mountain. May abandons his Velar for his boat, which sinks, causing him to lose the race. Because Clarkson's Stelvio has no tow bar he cheats and exchanges it for a [[Ford F-Series (thirteenth generation)|Ford F150 Raptor]], ultimately arriving first with the presenters concluding that the Raptor was better than all the SUVs being tested. On Conversation Street the presenters talk about new SUVs and vans. Clarkson reviews the [[Tesla Model X]] at the Eboladrome and on the road, accompanied by some lawyers, ostensibly to avoid Tesla pursuing any legal action, following the previous ''[[Tesla v. Top Gear]]'' court cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/02/tesla-vs-top-gear/|title=Judge Tosses Tesla's case against Top Gear|date=23 February 2012|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rory McIlroy]] and [[Paris Hilton]] discuss their car collections before McIlroy beats Hilton to become the &quot;World's Fastest Golfing Enthusiast&quot;.

The presenters head to [[Mozambique]] on a mission to feed the people of Bingo, an isolated town in the west of the country, with fish from the country's capital of [[Maputo]], covering a distance of approximately 200 miles. To do this, each of them attempt to find the best transport solution: May buys a [[Mercedes-Benz W123|Mercedes-Benz Estate]] and modifies it by fitting a Perspex tank filled with sea water in which to keep the fish alive; Clarkson buys a [[Nissan Navara#D22 Frontier (1997–2000)|Nissan Hardbody]] truck which he fits with a generator and an ice machine in an attempt to keep the fish frozen and Hammond buys a [[TVS Motor Company|TVS Star]] motorcycle and devises a rack which he fits to the bike's rear, inspired by a local method of drying and salting the fish to preserve them. After unsuccessfully trying to catch fish using local methods, they buy fish at a local market. Early in the journey, Clarkson's truck crashes into May's car upon rescuing it, damaging its radiator grille. Deeper into rural Mozambique, May constantly soaks himself with sea water from his ill-fitted tank and, due to his damaged radiator grille, suffers multiple breakdowns due to water intrusion. Hammond loses a large number of his fish on the bumpy roads, constantly gets stuck in thick mud and endlessly falls from his motorbike. Clarkson suffers very few issues except when his ice machine breaks, causing him to make small adjustments to his truck in order to smoke the fish with his exhaust. Upon May's car breaking down in the middle of a lake, despite Hammond and Clarkson crossing successfully, Clarkson cuts off the front end of the Mercedes and tows what remains of the rear portion using his truck - much to May's dismay and annoyance. Eventually, the three reach Bingo with May's fish dead, Clarkson's fish ruined and Hammond having almost no fish left. As a result, they sell no fish and leave Bingo in a helicopter &quot;like all charitable celebrities&quot;.
